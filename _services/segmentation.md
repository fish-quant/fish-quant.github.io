ImJoy plugins allow to perform **segmentation of cells and nuclei** with the CellPose package.

![Cell segmentation](/images/features/segmentation__cells.png)

> **Summary:** with this workflow, cell and nuclear segmentation can be performed on 2d images
> in a batch processing mode. For easy usage, analysis can be performed with ImJoy plugsins. We also
> provide additional plugins to transform 3d images into 2d images. Segmentation results can readily be
> used in other workflows, to assign RNA counts to segmentation resutls.
